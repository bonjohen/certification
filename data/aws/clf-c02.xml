      <title>Cloud Computing Benefits</title>
      <scenario>A startup is deciding whether to build their own data center or use cloud computing. They have unpredictable traffic patterns and limited upfront capital. The CTO wants to understand the key benefits of moving to the cloud.</scenario>
      <question-text>Which benefit of cloud computing allows the startup to pay only for the resources they actually use?</question-text>

        </hint>
        <hint level="2" label="Complete Explanation">
          <content>Pay-as-you-go pricing is a fundamental benefit of cloud computing. Instead of purchasing and maintaining expensive hardware upfront, companies pay only for the compute, storage, and other resources they actually use. This converts capital expenses (CapEx) to operational expenses (OpEx) and is ideal for startups with unpredictable workloads.</content>

              <li>AWS offers multiple pricing models: On-Demand (pay by the hour/second), Reserved Instances (commit for 1-3 years for discounts), Spot Instances (bid on unused capacity), and Savings Plans.</li>
              <li>The pay-as-you-go model eliminates the need for capacity forecasting and reduces the risk of over-provisioning or under-provisioning.</li>

      <title>Elasticity vs Scalability</title>
      <scenario>An e-commerce company experiences a 10x traffic spike during Black Friday sales, then returns to normal levels afterward. They need their infrastructure to automatically adjust to these demand changes.</scenario>

          <content>Elasticity is the cloud's ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on actual demand.

              <li>Elasticity helps optimize costs by scaling down during low-demand periods, avoiding paying for unused capacity.</li>
              <li>True elasticity requires stateless application design so instances can be added or removed without losing data.</li>
