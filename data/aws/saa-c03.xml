The endpoint DNS record is updated to point to the standby, so applications reconnect automatically.</content>

      <title>Decoupling with SQS</title>
      <scenario>A web application processes image uploads. The processing takes several minutes and causes timeouts when handled synchronously. The architecture needs to decouple the upload acceptance from the processing to improve reliability.</scenario>

          <content>Decoupling the upload acceptance from processing using SQS is the best approach. The web tier accepts uploads (stores images in S3), sends a message to SQS with the image location, and immediately responds to the user. Worker instances poll SQS and process images asynchronously.
