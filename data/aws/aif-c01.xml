          <content>Machine learning enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming.</content>

        <hint level="2" label="Complete Explanation">
          <content>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. Unlike traditional programming where rules are explicitly coded, ML systems discover patterns in data and use them to make inferences on new, unseen data. This allows ML to handle complex problems that would be difficult to solve with hand-coded rules.</content>

        </hint>
        <hint level="2" label="Complete Explanation">
          <content>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions, receives feedback (rewards or penalties), and learns a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. RL is used for robotics, game playing (like AlphaGo), recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.</content>
